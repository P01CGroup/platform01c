This rapid growth established Netflix as a market leader and a serious competitor to Blockbuster, the dominant DVD rental company at the time.</p><p>Netflix had bigger ambitions to transform the entertainment industry itself. In a bold and risky move, the company chose to disrupt its own business model. In 2007, despite the fact that only <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" class=""text-blue-600 underline cursor-pointer"" href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/189349/us-households-home-internet-connection-subscription/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">61.7%</a> of U.S. households had internet access, Netflix launched its streaming service, signaling a strategic shift toward digital consumption and the future of home entertainment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Trends driving Netflix’s hunger for revolution</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were five major reasons behind Netflix’s decision to enter the streaming market:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Technology</strong>: As the world rapidly transitioned into the digital age, Netflix recognized that being an early mover was essential to securing its position as a future market leader.</p></li><li><p><strong>Convenience</strong>: Netflix aimed to offer a seamless entertainment experience by allowing customers to enjoy their favorite content from the comfort of home, eliminating the need to visit physical stores to rent DVDs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The goal was to make entertainment available anytime, anywhere. Would give consumers the freedom to watch content on their own terms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affordability</strong>: By introducing a low-cost, subscription-based model with a simple and stress-free structure, Netflix removed the hassle associated with traditional DVD rentals and late fees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalization</strong>: Leveraging user data and algorithms, Netflix was able to recommend shows and movies tailored to each viewer’s preferences, helping users discover new favorites with ease.</p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Challenges Brought by the Shift</strong></h3><p>Netflix’s transition to streaming was a bold and forward-thinking move, but it came with a host of challenges. These obstacles tested the company’s resilience in its journey to transform the entertainment industry.</p><h4><strong>1. Lack of Streaming Content</strong></h4><ul><li><p>When Netflix launched its streaming service in 2007, the library content was limited to around 1,000 titles, as major studios were hesitant to license their premium content to a digital platform.</p></li><li><p>The few licenses Netflix did acquire were expensive, time-restricted, and non-exclusive, making it difficult to offer a compelling catalog.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>2. Lack of Streaming Technology</strong></h4><ul><li><p>At launch, Netflix’s streaming service could only be accessed via Internet Explorer on Windows. Mac users were unable to stream until late 2008.</p></li><li><p>The streaming quality was inferior to DVD versions, with noticeable reductions in resolution and performance.</p></li><li><p>Internet infrastructure was still developing, and frequent buffering issues frustrated users, leading to dissatisfaction with the streaming experience.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>3. Rising Competition</strong></h4><ul><li><p>By 2011, Netflix faced intense competition from emerging players like Hulu, Google TV, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime Video.</p></li><li><p>Hulu, for instance, matched Netflix’s subscription price of <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" class=""text-blue-600 underline cursor-pointer"" href=""https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/48480146/zGroupon_Case_Final_in_Print_JIACS_Vol_20_No_1_2014-libre.pdf?1472690323=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DAndrew_Mason_and_Groupon_Inc.pdf&amp;Expires=1750597264&amp;Signature=H46jx~AKAo0aXnkxvPoPJgsx2jA1aKCWtZ8ZhzrMga33vgpYl1nL-q7AaJQWV~YZ4mcW9qKxZUhk2hwcm8nm1Cfkw1eFPocayy8AzrMChHpRQEo6uAMAW~Y2QlMkta84gRmtT9IGCO7EKsbqZg2g7JyKvwDRmgyvuxMzMuvBHAg5Zc4BM422GF36su2wOSwXq2mEKh~aBCnnyLqvGa1ayb16n4od3fuwp-QnfwpSoeuRZLg6-7GMu-70Pa5uAJqVur~eyjMKNbdqQzVUzF-PfmrfGhhTdK~PYOXYXS6iX-GYoCut0vEQv4BMVbKvCybsh0UvO5MInaQR3-28it8yAw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA#page=145&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com"">$7.99</a> but also offered a free selection of previously aired TV shows—bringing a strong USP to the market.</p></li><li><p>Each competitor introduced unique features and content strategies, eroding Netflix’s early dominance in the streaming space.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, increased competition led to a surge in licensing costs, as demand for digital content rights grew rapidly.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>4.Pricing Crisis</strong></h4><ul><li><p>In 2011, amid a period of economic recession, Netflix restructured its subscription plans.</p></li><li><p>The company introduced three options: DVD-only, streaming-only, and a combination of both.

This data-driven strategy helped reduce costs while maintaining a desirable and diverse catalog for subscribers.</p></li><li><p>This allowed Netflix to transform its limited library into a compelling offer that attracted and retained millions of new subscribers, strengthening its market position against competitors.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Technological Advancements</strong></h4><ul><li><p>In 2008, Netflix began migrating its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), completing the transition by 2016. This move allowed for scalable, global delivery.</p></li><li><p>Netflix also developed its own content delivery network (CDN), Open Connect, which improved video quality and reduced distribution costs. This enabled streaming in over 190 countries worldwide.</p></li><li><p>Rather than developing its own hardware, Netflix focused on embedding its app across third-party devices, including gaming consoles, smart TVs, and streaming sticks, eliminating user interface fragmentation and enhancing accessibility by late 2009.</p></li><li><p>These innovations turned around poor streaming quality and accessibility issues, delivering a smooth user experience that set Netflix apart and enabled massive global expansion.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Investment in Original Content</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Netflix took its first step into original content by acquiring streaming rights for Breaking Bad from AMC in later seasons, helping to popularize the “Netflix Original” label.</p></li><li><p>In 2013, Netflix launched its first self-produced original series, House of Cards, with a budget of <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" class=""text-blue-600 underline cursor-pointer"" href=""https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/icemed-22/125975368?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">$3.85 million</a>.
